# 5725-Final-Project
Covid-Tracker
Our project is to use web crawlers to crawl the epidemic data on the website, and visualize the crawled data and display it on piTFT. We use python to implement a web crawler, select the webpage with the data we are interested in as the target webpage, crawl the data on the webpage every hour, and store it locally. Further read the data to generate maps and tables for visualization.
